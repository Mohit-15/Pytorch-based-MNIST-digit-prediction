# Pytorch based Digit prediction using MNIST Dataset

The model is made using Pytorch and the dataset used is MNIST dataset. 
The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the **Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset**. 
It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.

The mean value and deviation in **MNIST dataset** are 0.1307 and 0.3081.

### The Flask API
I have used flask framework to make the API, which takes the image and predict the digit class.
